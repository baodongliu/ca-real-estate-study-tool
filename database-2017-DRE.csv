The applicant may refuse to answer about race since the information is optional on the typical real estate loan application.

The borrower, then, may refuse to answer the question."
Diagnostic Pre-Test,Which is a correct statement?:,The effective interest rate is the interest rate paid and the nominal interest rate is the minimal rate that is charged.,The nominal interest rate is the percentage of interest that is actually paid by the borrower and the effective interest rate is the percentage of interest that is stated in the loan.,The nominal interest rate is the same as the annual percentage rate (APR).,The effective interest rate is the percentage of interest that is actually paid by the borrower and the nominal interest rate is the percentage of interest that is stated in the loan.,d,Answer: D.

This is usually provided for in the capitalization rate in the income approach. Accrued depreciation (past) is used in the cost approach.
Valuation and Market Analysis (Appraisal),Usefulness of the cost approach is limited when appraising:,in an unusually active real estate market.,a new structure on an appropriate site.,for construction.,an older property with many functional deficiencies.,d,"Answer: D. The usefulness of the cost approach method of appraisal is limited when appraising an older property with many functional deficiencies because of the difficulty in determining all of the accrued depreciation. Appraising a new structure or for construction would probably have little, if any, functional deficiencies. In an unusually active real estate market the comparison approach would be the most significant approach to use, but the cost approach could still be useful."
Valuation and Market Analysis (Appraisal),The gross multiplier is LEAST likely to be used in the appraisal of:,apartment buildings.,a residence.,commercial property.,vacant land.,d,Answer: D.

What is most likely the reason?:,One house had more wear and tear.,One house was considered to have functional obsolescence.,Both houses were across the street from a nonconforming house that resulted in economic obsolescence.,One house had more economic obsolescence.,b,"Answer: B. One house must have functional obsolescence. Since the properties are in the same location, the same age, and have been maintained the same, the difference in value cannot be attributed to economic obsolescence or wear and tear. As an example, one house may have only a single-car garage or only one bathroom or a less attractive floor plan."

The lender of a prior loan that includes such a clause agrees to relinquish the priority of his or her trust deed to specified financing to be obtained by the borrower at a later date. Without a subordination clause, a construction lender, desiring first position, would be unwilling to finance the improvements unless the first loan was paid."

Transfer of Property,Who is normally in the weakest position against loss of property due to a claim by an outsider?:,Holder of an unrecorded quitclaim deed who does not occupy the property,Holder of an unrecorded deed who occupies the property,Holder of a recorded deed who rents the property,Holder of a certificate of title,a,"Answer: A. An unrecorded deed is considered void as against a subsequent good-faith purchaser who is without notice and who does record or take possession. The two methods of giving constructive notice of a claim of interest are (1) recording and (2) occupying the property. A holder of an unrecorded quitclaim deed who does not occupy the property has done neither. For a holder of a certificate of title, the certificate is indicative that the named holder is the owner of the record."
Transfer of Property,An escrow company can:,request funding of the buyer's loan.,order a termite report and authorize the work to be done.,change the amount of the broker's commission.,tell the buyers where to obtain the best available financing.,a,"Answer: A. While escrow procedures vary somewhat according to local custom, one of the steps that comes after preparing escrow instructions, ordering the title search, and accepting the structural pest control reports is for the escrow officer to call for the closing funds that are deposited into the escrow. The escrow could not authorize work to be done, change the broker's commission, or tell the buyers where to obtain financing."

Transfer of Property,Recording a deed:,insures possession.,gives actual notice.,raises presumption of delivery.,transfers title.,c,"Answer: C. A deed must be acknowledged to be recorded. The fact that it has been recorded indicates that the grantor signed it, acknowledged it, and let it out of his or her hands; therefore, a presumption of delivery is made, albeit a rebuttable presumption."
Transfer of Property,"In California, the abstract of title has ultimately been replaced by the:",certificate of title.,policy of title insurance.,title guarantee.,trust deed.,b,"Answer: B. Title insurance companies evolved from abstract companies, which first issued ""abstracts of title.""

Documents that affect title or interests in real property are eligible to be recorded to obtain the protection that recording affords (constructive notice to the world of the contents of the document) but most are not required to be recorded to be effective. ""A deed of reconveyance must be recorded"" is a false statement and therefore the correct choice. It may be foolish not to record a deed of reconveyance, but recording is not required."
Transfer of Property,"The purchase price of a property amounted to $50,000 with the buyer assuming an existing $30,000 loan. If the documentary transfer tax is $0.55 for each $500 or fraction thereof, what was the tax paid on the transaction?:",$33,$55,$44,$22,d,"Answer: D. $50,000 Purchase price –30,000 Loan $20,000 Equity $20,000 ÷ $500 = 40 × $0.55 $22"

Transfer of Property,A buyer purchased a property at 20% less than the listed price and later sold it for the original listed price. What was the percentage of profit based on his cost?:,40%,20%,25%,10%,c,"Answer: C. Percentage of profit in real estate is based on cost, not selling price. Since he bought at 80% of the listed price, he sold for 1/4th more than he paid for it (20 is 25% of 80). % x Paid = Made % x 80% = 20% 20% ÷ 80% = 0.25 = 25%"
Transfer of Property,"A property owner had the following monthly payments: principal $402; interest $202; real property taxes $104; fire insurance $21.

As to his income tax position:",his gain may be deferred.,his gain is taxable as ordinary income.,he has to pay capital gains on the amount of the depreciation.,he has no recognized gain.,c,"Answer: C. Depreciation reduces the original cost basis, thereby increasing the difference between the selling price and the new (or ""adjusted"") cost basis. That difference is a long-term capital gain on which the taxpayer will pay taxes. In this case, Smith's gain equaled the depreciation taken."
Transfer of Property,Who would provide a quitclaim deed to quiet a title?:,Grantor,Grantee,Trustor,None of these,a,"Answer: A. Quitclaim deeds are executed by grantors to clear up conflicting claims or deficiencies in titles, in favor of grantees."

The representative of the estate may, with the court's approval, give a broker an exclusive listing, not to exceed 90 days; an offer must be at least 90% of the court's appraisal. The court may then approve the sale and set the commission."

The seller took a purchase money second trust deed for $325,000 and sold it ""without recourse"" at a discount of $323,500. The buyer defaulted before the first payment was made. The holder of the second trust deed can:","foreclose for $323,500.","foreclose for $325,000.","look to the seller since ""without recourse"" has no effect.",look to the seller since the note was usurious.,b,"Answer: B. The seller was not liable on the trust deed note and would not be liable for the default of the trustor. He or she further assured against liability by stating that the sale was ""without recourse."" (This means that the buyer could not look to the seller of the note for satisfaction of the buyer's default.) The buyer of the note is entitled to foreclose on the face value of the note for $325,000, not the $323,500 he paid for it."
Transfer of Property,There are different types of title insurance. The major differences between the owner's title insurance policy and the lender's title insurance policy include:,an owner's insurance covers the water and mining rights that the owner can claim.,a lender's insurance covers the interests of the mortgagee.,a lender's insurance extends coverage on easements and possession that is difficult to ascertain at time of purchase.,a lender's insurance covers the interest of the seller but owner's insurance covers the title.,b,"Answer: B. A lender's insurance policy (an ALTA policy) insures the interests of that lender, or mortgagee. An owner's policy (a CLTA policy) insures the owner against risks of record and some off-record hazards such as forgery and lack of capacity. Only the ALTA policy extends coverage to water and mining rights. An ALTA policy does extend coverage to off-record easements and rights of parties in possession, but not because the information is difficult to ascertain."
Transfer of Property,"In determining whether to insure title, the title company would rely most on documents found in the:",title report.,title guarantee.,chain of title.,title search.,d,"Answer: D. A title search is an examination of matters disclosed by the public records, including the county recorder's office and such other sources as the county clerk, various tax agencies, federal court clerk, and the Secretary of State.

Transfer of Property,Which item would most likely be short rated in escrow?:,Interest,Trust deed,Real estate taxes,Insurance,d,"Answer: D. Taxes and interest in an assumption are usually prorated in escrow. If the seller's insurance is taken over by the buyer, the seller will be credited proportionately (pro rata) for the portion of the premium the buyer is debited for. When the buyer gets new insurance, the seller's policy will be canceled and the premium returned to the seller by the insurance company short-rated on a uniform schedule approved by the insurance commissioner."

Transfer of Property,What would never appear as a debit to the buyer on a closing statement?:,Tax prorations,FHA discount points on an FHA loan,Interest on an assumed loan,Insurance prorations,c,"Answer: C. Interest payments are paid in arrears, that is, the payments are made to the lender only for the period during which the borrower had full use of the funds. Therefore, when a loan is taken over by the buyer, let's say in the middle of the interest-paying period, one half would be owed by the seller and the remaining one half by the buyer. Since the buyer will be obligated to pay the lender at the end of the scheduled payment period, and for the whole amount even though he owes only for one half of it, the debit made to the seller in escrow will therefore be credited to the buyer. Discount points on a new FHA loan would likely be a debit on the buyer's closing statement. Prepaid insurance premiums could be prorated and would be a debit to the buyer. Tax prorations could go either way."
Transfer of Property,The requisites of a grant deed differ from those of a land contract in which way?:,Designation of price,Warranties to purchaser,All of these,Signature of principals,c,Answer: C. A grant deed carries a warranty to the purchaser; a land contract does not. The grant deed requires the signature of the grantor only; a land contract requires the signature of the vendor and the vendee. A grant deed does not require a designation of the price; a land contract does.

Transfer of Property,"If a seller received a check from escrow in the amount of $111,561.30 and escrow had deducted a commission of 6% of the selling price and other expenses of $1,210.50, the gross selling price was:","$111,277.80.","$110,067.30.","$111,561.30.","$119,970.00.",d,"Answer: D. $111,561.30 + $1,210.50 = $112,771.80 (100% – Commission %) × GSP = NET (EEC) (Everything except commission) (1.00 – 0.06) × GSP = $112,771.80"
Transfer of Property,"In making a title search, a title company would most likely search the records of:",the Federal Land Office.,all of these.,the county clerk.,the county recorder's office.,b,"Answer: B.

Transfer of Property,"The first installment of real property taxes had been paid by the seller for the current fiscal year. Property taxes for the current fiscal year amounted to $1,200. If escrow closed on February 1, what amount of prorated taxes would the seller be required to pay?:",$200,$600,"$1,200",$100,d,"Answer: D. The date of the item (DI) is January 1. The close of escrow (COE) is February 1. Since the DI is short of COE, the seller owes for this one month. One month's taxes would be $100."
Transfer of Property,"Carson acquired title to several properties before his arrest. While in prison, he wanted to convey one property to his son and sell another. How would being in prison affect his ability to convey?:",His conveyance must be approved by an officer of the Department of Corrections.,He must first get permission from the California Adult Authority.,He can dispose of his property as he pleases.,It would be hard to acquire title insurance.,c,Answer: C.

Recording a deed gives constructive notice to the world of the contents of the deed. The recording laws were enacted to protect innocent third parties.

The deed itself is valid between the grantor and the grantee, but invalid as against an innocent purchaser without notice."

To be eligible for a Section 1031 exchange, a property must be held for income or investment or be property held for productive use in trade or business.

""A party to the exchange can deduct a loss on the exchange"" is incorrect as the loss is not attributable at time of exchange. ""A rented house cannot be exchanged for an office building"" is incorrect as rental property can be exchanged for an office building."
