A section contains 640 acres.

Finally, now that it is known how many square feet are in this parcel of land, multiply this total by the price per square foot. 1,742,400 sq. ft. x $4 = $6,969,600 Solution: $6,969,600.

How much was the transfer tax charged?",$426.80.,$213.13.,$426.25.,$213.40.,a,"a — At the close of escrow, a tax is paid to the county as part of the recording process. The basic tax rate is $0.55 per $500. For this problem, first determine the rate per $1,000. $0.55 x 2 = $1.10 per $1,000 Remember, transfer tax is charged by rounding up to the next $500 increment. Therefore, in this problem, the value is rounded up to $388,000. Since the tax rate will be calculated on a per $1,000 basis, divide the rounded sales price by 1,000. $388,000 / 1,000 = $388 Next, multiply this total by the $1.10 transfer tax stamp rate. $388 x $1.10 = $426.80 Solution: $426.80."
