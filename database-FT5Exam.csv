None of the alternative answer choices speak to what a lease is. A lease can also be called a less-than-freehold estate, as a freehold estate constitutes ownership.

(ALTA) title policy.,d,"d – This is a LEAST question. An abstract of title is simply a report showing the chain of title issued by the title company after a search of title records.

Using the capitalization approach to appraise the properties, the government building would demand a capitalization rate (cap rate).",lower,similar,higher,Cannot be determined.,a,"a – A government building would demand a lower capitalization rate (cap rate) than a used car lot.

Simulated-Exam,Which of the following does not contribute to obsolescence?,Outdated appliances.,Changes in flight pattern from local airport.,Misplaced improvements.,Physical deterioration.,d,"d – This is a NOT question.

Thus, the contract in question is also executory."
Simulated-Exam,Which of these documents provides the most protection to a property owner in default?,A first trust deed.,A mortgage.,A land sales contract.,A fixed-term lease with an option to buy.,b,"b –A mortgage requires a judicial foreclosure and thus offers the greatest protection as the owner is provided a longer period of time to cure the default. A trust deed is generally foreclosed through a nonjudicial trustee’s sale, which can occur more quickly and provide little opportunity for the owner to cure the default.

In this situation, the:",buyer has no recourse.,salesperson is guilty of puffing which is not a crime.,salesperson’s broker is subject to discipline.,salesperson and their broker may be found guilty of fraud.,d,"d – A salesperson and their broker may be found guilty of fraud if they make a prediction about the future represented as fact, which later turns out to be incorrect. If the buyer accepted the salesperson’s statement as fact, there are legal consequences. Thus, answer selection A cannot be correct. The definitive representation that the property’s value will double in three years rises beyond puffing, and thus B is also not correct. Answer choice C suggests the responsibility will apply only to the broker, which is not the case."
Simulated-Exam,"When an interest in property is acquired by prescription rather than adverse possession, the interest may be described as:",the right to use land which belongs to someone else.,a private grant.,legal title.,a cloud on title to the benefiting property.,a,"a – The full name for a prescription is a prescriptive easement. A prescriptive easement is the right to use another’s property established by the adverse use of the property for a period in excess of five years without a claim of ownership. This is neither a grant or legal title, nor does it cloud the title of the benefiting property. A prescriptive easement does, however, give the right to use land to someone other than the owner."

Answer selections A and C are similar, although C allows the funds to be kept anywhere so long as they are not converted, which is not correct. Answer selection D is unreasonable since most sellers under a land sales contract will not be licensed, and thus the California Bureau of Real Estate (CalBRE) is not involved. Choice B suggests conversion is acceptable, which is not correct."
